		Mediators that listen for JSystem  events (dispatched by RunnerListenersManager), convert <br>
		the events to JMX notification and dispatch the notifications.<br>
		The events that the listeners listen to are events that are needed for the <br>
		remote client.<br>
		Listeners were split to several classes (class for each interface) to adjust
		to RunnerListenersManager behaviour. Don't merge listeners.
